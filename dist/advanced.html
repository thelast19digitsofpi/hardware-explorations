Let's think about how we might multiply two numbers in base ten. The standard method is to do something like this:</p> <pre style="font-size:large">
	   471
	&times; 1011
	------
	   471
	  471
	 000
	471
	------
	476181
			</pre> <p>You might have noticed that I deliberately chose to make the second number only have the digits 0 and 1. This is a very useful feature of binary: since the bits can only ever be 0 or 1, at each step, we either add the number as is or we don't. (In contrast, with base ten we might have to add some multiple of 471.)</p> <p>Normally, a computer would store each number as 32 or 64 bits, but for simplicity we will only use 6 bits. Now, it is possible to arrange six adders and pipe in the correct inputs, but that gets a bit unwieldy if you try to imagine 64 of them. Instead, I'll use a slower but simpler approach that involves doing the adds one at a time. Part of the reason for this is in analogy with the division method we will see later.</p> <p>The trick is to start with a blank "canvas" (register) of zero bits. It's easier to keep the adder in one place and move bit values, so we add into the upper 6 bits (the final answer may be as large as 12 bits) and then shift the register downward. (By "shift", I mean to shift the <strong>values</strong> of the bits. So in a shift cycle, each bit inherits the value of its left neighbor.) In decimal, it looks like this:</p> <pre>
	Register:  000000    [1011]
	Add:       471000    [101<strong>1</strong>]
	Shift:     047100    [ 101]
	Add:       518100    [ 10<strong>1</strong>]
	Shift:     051810    [  10]
	Don't add: 051810    [  1<strong>0</strong>] (don't add because of the 0)
	Shift:     005181    [   1]
	Add:       476181    [   <strong>1</strong>]
	</pre> <p>To implement this in hardware, we need to keep track of which bit in the second number we are on. The easiest way to do this is with a second register of size 6. It gets shifted when the large one does, and we just tell the adder to keep the original value of the register if that bit is 0. (Notice the "Don't add" step above because the hundreds digit was a zero.)</p> <p>So here we come to the hardware. There's a lot going on here, but don't panic! A detailed explanation follows, but see if you can figure out what's going on by watching it.</p> <p><strong>Heads up!</strong> Unlike the previous simulations that calculated immediately, multiplication and division take time. To operate this version:</p> <ol> <li>Click on the row of circles in the upper left to make the first number.</li> <li>Click on the row of circles in the upper right to make the second number.</li> <li>When you are ready, click the large red button to start. Once it starts, click the <strong>Step</strong> button to the right of (or below, on small screens) the exploration repeatedly.</li> <li>You can also adjust the speed and click <strong>Play</strong> to animate the exploration.</li> </ol> <p>For best results, try setting the second input to something with several 1 bits and several 0 bits. A good number for this is 110011 (51). <div class="exploration" id="multiplier-full"></div> </p><h3>Multiplication: What Just Happened?</h3> <p>All right, so maybe all that wiring confused you a little. Let's go through it piece by piece. You probably noticed there were two alternating actions, which I will call "add" and "shift". "Shift" moves a bunch of values and "add" helps the product grow. In more detail:</p> <div class="clearfix"> <img src="mult_b.91183ea8.png" alt="Closeup of the upper right" class="float-start img-thumbnail me-2" width="300"> <p>This portion of the circuit, surrounding the second input, copies that input into a register. The wires coming from the upper right come from a NOT gate on the start button. If the start button is off, that not gate is on, so the selectors will choose the input bits, effectively <b>resetting this register</b>. Otherwise, they will select the value of the <b>previous bit, thus trying to shift the register</b>.</p> <p>However, the "write" signal is connected to an OR gate. The "write" is active when the teal wires are on OR the start button is off. Teal is the "shift" signal, and the start button being off is a reset. So <b>in shift phase, the values all move one place right</b>, but <b>in add phase, this register stays put</b>. The value of the LSB (least significant bit) doesn't go anywhere in shift phase, but it does have another purpose...</p> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <img src="mult_adder.78c388b5.png" alt="Closeup of the Adder" class="float-start img-thumbnail me-2" width="300"> <p>...and for that, we come to the adder. Its purpose is to <b>add the first input</b> to the upper 6 bits of the product register. The selector decides whether to use this sum (if the LSB from above is 1) or keep the state as is (if 0). The faded purple wire is connected to the product register, while the solid purple wire comes down to more selectors.</p> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <img src="mult_prodReg.f234e68a.png" alt="Closeup of the Adder" class="float-start img-thumbnail me-2" width="300"> <p>Those selectors then control what happens to the product register. Because there are only two phases, I decided not to make these formal "register" bits, but in practice you can still think of it as a register. The faded teal wires are the control signal for shifting (just like above). When those are active, all the bit values slide one place to the right. Otherwise, the bits on the right hold their own state, while those on the left receive the value from the selector above (which might or might not be the addition result).</p> </div> <p>Of course, now we just made a value that has twice as many bits as the computer. If your computer is 64-bit, then the multiplication can theoretically use as many as 128 bits. (Challenge: Find a multiplication in the above where the 12th bit from the right is a 1.) One approach, used by the MIPS architecture, is to store the result in a special "high" and "low" register. Then, programs can use an instruction called <code>mfhi</code> and <code>mflo</code> ("move from high/low") to extract the two halves separately. Usually only the lower half is actually used; the upper half would only check if there is overflow.</p> <h3>Division</h3> <p>Long division is also rather tricky. Let's take the example from earlier with a slight modification:</p> <pre>
&nbsp;   <u>    1011</u>
471 | 476223
&nbsp;   &nbsp; 471
&nbsp;   &nbsp; ---
&nbsp;   &nbsp;  05223
&nbsp;   &nbsp;  000
&nbsp;   &nbsp;  -----
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   5223
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   471
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   ----
&nbsp;   &nbsp;    513
&nbsp;   &nbsp;    471

			</pre> <p>Many things are similar to multiplication, actually. If you remember the multiplication hardware, we started with an empty register, and added to the left half and then shifted all the bits to the right. Here, we do the opposite: the register now starts with the numerator, and we repeatedly subtract and shift <em>left</em>.</p> <p>When the subtractor gets its result, we first check the carry-out bit and see if it is 0. (If it were 1, then we got a negative result.) This is sent into choice gates to decide whether or not to use the subtraction.</p> <p>Now, a naive implementation of the hardware would just have a second register for storing the quotient. However, because of the way we shift the register upward, we can actually just use the lower half of the register to hold the quotient.</p> <p>Why is this? Well, when done this way, we can now use the same hardware for multiplication and division! The <code>mfhi</code> instruction would now mean "extract the remainder", and <code>mflo</code> now gets the quotient. </p> <p>Like before, I made the power button shut itself off when the computation is done. Notice how it immediately resets the big row now. The top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator.</p> <div class="exploration" id="divider-full"></div> <p>Here's a few things to try:</p> <ul> <li>Try some stress tests: 63 divided by 1, 63 divided by 63, 1 divided by 63, 1 divided by 1, 0 divided by 1 or 63.</li> <li>What happens if you divide by zero? See if you can guess, then try it. (A real computer would issue some kind of error if you tried to do so, but that requires more work.)</li> </ul> </div> </body><script src="main.77eb61d2.js"></script></html>
