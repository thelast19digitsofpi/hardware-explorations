Normally, however, the inputs would also be signed, and so what above appears as 11 - 13 would actually be (-5) - (-3), which is still -5 + 3 = -2. Computations like 6 - (-4) would give -6 instead of +10, but this is exactly the same overflow problem as with the signed addition 6 + 4.</p> <h3>Multiplication</h3> <p>There's a lot going on here, but don't panic! A detailed explanation follows, but see if you can figure out what's going on by watching it. Click the 6 bits just above the adder to set the first number, and the 6 bits to their right for the second one. The giant circle is the power button. Try not to mess with the circuit when it's on!</p> <p>Oh, and one more thing: The clock with lots of circles (14, to be exact) controls the answer at the bottom. If you wait too long, it will cycle again and erase the answer! You can turn the power off to prevent this.</p> <div class="exploration" id="multiplier-full"></div> <h3>Multiplication: What Just Happened?</h3> <h3>Division</h3> <p>Many things are similar to multiplication, actually. This time, though, we start with the dividend (numerator; the 42 in 42/5) in the big row.</p> <p>In long division, usually </p> <p>I programmed the simulation to shut itself off when the computation is done. Notice that it takes a little time to <div class="exploration" id="divider-full"></div> </p><p>Here's a few things to try:</p> <ul> <li>Try some stress tests: 63 divided by 1, 63 divided by 63, 1 divided by 63, 1 divided by 1, 0 divided by 1 or 63.</li> <li>What happens if you divide by zero? See if you can guess, then try it.</li> </ul> </body><script src="main.61aeab40.js"></script></html>
