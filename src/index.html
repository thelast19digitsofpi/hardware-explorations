		<h1>Binary Operations</h1>

		<h3>Registers</h3>
		<p>We've seen operations like addition, where all of the logic happens at once and you see the result at the end. However, multiplication and division are more complicated, and so we need to break up the problem into several steps.</p>
		<p>In order to do that, we need some more persistent components, something that can "remember" what it had before. That looks difficult, but we can actually implement it fairly easily with a simple trick: we take the output and wire it back into the input!</p>
		<p>The design I am going to use is non-informatively called a "D latch". The button on the left controls which signal goes in to the </p>

		<p>Now, of course, in practice there are easier ways to do this using transistors, but this is a little easier to grasp. Usually we think of a register as being 32 or 64 bits, but we can just repeat this design for each bit of the register. On the right I've simplified this down to a single component.</p>

		<h3>Clocks</h3>
		<p>To do multiplication and division, we're going to need some time. I've given the clock a "power" input that can be used to reset it, and arranged the output sockets horizontally.</p>

		<p>Here the inputs are actually unsigned, so we need 5 bits to represent the output (which can range from -15 to +15). Normally, however, the inputs would also be signed, and so what above appears as 11 - 13 would actually be (-5) - (-3), which is still -5 + 3 = -2. Computations like 6 - (-4) would give -6 instead of +10, but this is exactly the same overflow problem as with the signed addition 6 + 4.</p>

		<h3>Multiplication</h3>
		<p>There's a lot going on here, but don't panic! A detailed explanation follows, but see if you can figure out what's going on by watching it. Click the 6 bits just above the adder to set the first number, and the 6 bits to their right for the second one. The giant circle is the power button. Try not to mess with the circuit when it's on!</p>
		<p>Oh, and one more thing: The clock with lots of circles (14, to be exact) controls the answer at the bottom. If you wait too long, it will cycle again and erase the answer! You can turn the power off to prevent this.</p>

		<h3>Multiplication: What Just Happened?</h3>

		<h3>Division</h3>
		<p>Many things are similar to multiplication, actually. This time, though, we start with the dividend (numerator; the 42 in 42/5) in the big row.</p>
		<p>In long division, usually </p>
		<p>I programmed the simulation to shut itself off when the computation is done. Notice that it takes a little time to

		<p>Here's a few things to try:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Try some stress tests: 63 divided by 1, 63 divided by 63, 1 divided by 63, 1 divided by 1, 0 divided by 1 or 63.</li>
			<li>What happens if you divide by zero? See if you can guess, then try it.</li>
